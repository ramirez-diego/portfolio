										<h3 class="major">Project Description</h3>
										<p>
											Basically, this was an online food delivery system. Customers could go to a website, browse for different food items and then place the order which would be sent to the store. The store receives the order through the server along with the customer information such as name and address. They prepare the order and send a delivery driver with the order to the customer's place. The driver sends its location continously to both the store and the customer through a mobile app or the default browser and some data that would associate him/her with a particular order. However, as this project places a big emphasis on the privacy of the drivers, it would only send a reduced location. So, they can only be located within an adjustable distance radius.
										</p>
										<p>
											This system was developed as part of a course project that focused mostly on Data Stream Management Systems and maintaining user privacy. It consisted of different user interfaces for delivery drivers, company management and customers. On the backed, it needed 2 servers, one for handling HTTP requests from the UIs and the other one receving continuous GPS data from delivery drivers (Data Stream Management System). Finally we included a MySQL static DB for managing user and company information. 
										</p>
										
										<h3 class="major">Development Process</h3>
										<p>
											The development team consisted of 7 people working in an agile environment, it was divided in front-end group, backend group and Data Management group. My work was centered around the backend of the system. More specifically, I worked on writing and setting up the server using PHP and Apache. This server handled the integration of the Database, the Data Stream Management System and the different User Interfaces (front-end). Our team used Scrum for project management in an agile environment. We had weekly meetings where the whole team was present to discuss any issues. During these meetings everyone was updated on each other's work and solutions to problems were suggested.
