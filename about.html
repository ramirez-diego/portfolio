										<h3 class="major">Something About me</h3>
										<p>
											I'm a computer science student about to complete my last semester in Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, BC.  Throughout my degree, I've learned different programming languages and I have familiarized myself with the main fields of computer science. The areas that interested me the most were web development and AI. So, I've dedicated a significant part of my spare time to learn about them on my own. I spent 2 semesters studying in Germany as an exchange student, during which I took courses that weren't avaialable in my home university. I've worked on several projects of different sizes that required a vast range of skills. Some of those projects were developed for real clients who ended up using the resulting system in their everyday lives.
										</p>

										<p>
											 For me, the biggest satisfaction is solving complex problems in the simplest and most elegant way possible. I believe that even small projects should meet high standards of quality and I always strive to write good code by following the industry's best practices.
											I couldn't be more satisfied with my chosen field of study. Computer science is certainly the highest growing industry in the last decade and everything indicates that it will continue to be that way. Developing software is without a doubt one of the most powerful tools we have at our hands. I am excited to join the industry and start solving all kinds of problems with my skills.
